# Walfas-J
Walfas but remade in the Java programming language

DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES THINK ABOUT USING THIS!!!
There is a reason why this project was abandoned.
1. Horrible programming (2025 me doesn't even want to look at what 2023 me did...)
2. I came to a realization that attempting to recreate Walfas from the ground up isn't the best idea. You are better off using some sort of Adobe Flash projector program on the original swf version. And besides, most people use external programs with extracted Walfas assets anyways...
